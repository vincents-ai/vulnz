# declared module registries:
#
#     git clone <repo> && nix build
#
# A filesystem `replace` directive in go.mod silently breaks that guarantee: the
# build succeeds on a developer workstation with adjacent checkouts and fails on
# a clean runner. This gate fails the build instead.
#
# It also rejects the absolute-path replaces that are worse still, because they
# hardcode one developer's home directory into a published module.
